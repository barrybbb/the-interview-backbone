Enter your full name and gravatar email address and hit "Join Interview".

Click "Get Started" to start using the Whiteboard function.

Click "Logout" to logout of the app.

Click the "Toggle" button to toggle the drawing whiteboard and video whiteboard.

Hover over the video to show the video controls where you can "Mute Audio" or "Mute Video" or "Stop Video".

NOTE: Screensharing requires https and our open source [chrome extension](https://github.com/respoke/respoke-chrome-extension). We will update this readme with more information configuring the chrome extension when it is released. Also, we'll update with more information on generating your own self-signed certs for use during development (though the ones here should work fine).
